# Advent Of Code 2025
Notes:

Day 1 Dial Safe
  Tricky special case in part2.

Day 2 Invalid Codes
  Could refactor with a better way of finding interger divisors.

Day 3 Battery safety limit override
  Straightforward. Part2 the sliding search window was good to figure out.

Day 4 Forklift trucking
  part2 lends itself a cool animation.

Day 5 Fresh Products
  Part 2 is this years entry which cannot be brute forced.
  
  The solution
  Where the ranges overlap .. one must be exoanded, the other must be deleted.
  TODO: 
    Given my solution takes 17 seconds on release mode 
    I should go back and look at the sub-optimal performance.

Day 6 Multiple Divide

Day 7 Beam Splitter
  Part one: Nice algorithm using .retain() on a hashSet and building up a list of beams to add 
  as the rows progress.
